# 3DIP Program+Processes Internal
 
If my program from the GitHub repository does not work when copied into python and ran, please note that some functionalities may be affected when ran on your personal computer. This is because my program uses an SQL server to store a database, which is stored locally within my own computer. This is because I do not have access to an external SQL server to connect my program and database to. As such, if functionalities of program do not work on your computer, please note this is likely due to the database being stored locally on mine. For evidence of full functionality of my program, refer to my testing and trialling tables, and my full videos running through the full program and its full functionality, with section 4, 6 and 8 of this assessment.
